I have come far.
Now begins my greatest competition, with myself, to become the most extraordinary person I can be!

arg1 is what I seek, and through it, arg2 .
My enemies are many, but my hunger for arg3 is unstoppable.
My ideal self will arg4 , but in order to get there, I need to fight reality first.
break
For me, the most important thing in life is arg5 .
At times, when I am at a low point in life, I will still keep my passion for arg6 alive.
I will not back down. I will continue to push forward and become a stronger person!

I'm grateful for disappointment, for letting me know the things that matter to me the most.
I have survived 100 percent of my worst days in life, so I just need to keep going.
No doubts or fears will be able to stop me from reaching my dream of arg7 because I am resilient and strong.
break
I'm grateful for my fear of arg8 for letting me know the opportunities for growth.
I will face the scary situations because I know I can accomplish great things if I push myself out of the comfort zone.
If I didn't face my fears, I wouldn't be doing the amazing things I am doing today.
break
And most importantly I am thankful for arg9 .
I will not forget how much I am worth and I will not let someone else tell me otherwise.
break
My time is limited, I need to accept where I am now, and go all out until I can do what I truly love.
It's not easy to change but I can do it.
break
I am that individual who is willing to let go of negative things such as arg10 in order to achieve his goals.
I can push pass all of the expectations, including my own.
I will be strong for those who need me and I will be a superhero for myself.
The only person responsible for my success is me.
break
I can do this!
